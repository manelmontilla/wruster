# Wruster

[![Rust](https://github.com/manelmontilla/wruster/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/manelmontilla/wruster/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Wruster is a experimental web server.

Even though itÂ´s a fully functional web server is intended to experiment and no
to be used in production.

## Status

The project is still in alfa status, the public API is particularly in very
early stages and stills lags access to many configuration options of some of
the components. That's also true for the documentation, that covers only the
basics for running a ``server`` and executing handlers but not a fine grain
configuration of the behavior of the Server.

## Example

This small program runs a web server listening at: 127.0.0.1:8082, accepts
GET requests at the root path, and returns a response with the payload: ``hello
world``.

```rust
use env_logger::Builder;
use std::process;
use std::str::FromStr;
use std::time::Duration;

use log::LevelFilter;
use wruster::handlers::log_middleware;
use wruster::http;
use wruster::http::Response;
use wruster::router;
use wruster::router::HttpHandler;
use wruster::{Server, Timeouts};

#[macro_use]
extern crate log;

fn main() {
   Builder::new().filter_level(LevelFilter::Info).init();
   let routes = router::Router::new();
   let handler: HttpHandler = log_middleware(Box::new(move |_| {
       Response::from_str("hello world").unwrap()
   }));
   routes.add("/", http::HttpMethod::GET, handler);
   let mut server = Server::new();
   if let Err(err) = server.run("127.0.0.1:8082", routes) {
      error!("error running wruster {}", err.to_string());
      process::exit(1);
  };
  if let Err(err) = server.wait() {
      error!("error running wruster {}", err.to_string());
      process::exit(1);
  };
  process::exit(0);
}
```

## Objectives

- Allow to experiment with different strategies for managing I/O: thread per
connection, thread per request, etc..

- Include the minimun necessary components to write relatively ``low level`` web
backend machinery, think about: reverse proxies, static content servers or
HTTP Load balancers.

- The performance is only taken into account at the amortized time complexity
level, not at the constant level.

## Design

The web server is composed basically of three high level components.

### HTTP Messages plumbing

Contains all the types needed to represent HTTP Messages, and to
read and write them ``from`` and ``to`` the wire.

### Router

Allows to the define and search routes. A route is a triplet: (path, http verb, handler)
that defines which action (``handler``) must be executed when a request with a concrete
``path`` and ``verb`` is received.

The current router implementation is backed by a
[Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) structure, so the cost of querying
the path of a route is O(m) where ``m`` is the length in chars of the path.

Also the Router is designed to be safe for multithread only for querying routes,
so it supposes it will be constructed using a single thread and won't be modified
after that.

### Thread pool

Defines the strategy to create and assign threads to execute the Handlers
defined in the routes.

The current implementation allows to define a ``minimun`` and a ``maximun``
number of threads. The minimun defines the number of threads that are allocated
when the pool is created. The maximun defines how many extra threads can be
allocated dynamically when the initial created threads are busy.

### Server

Accepts TCP connections listening in a given address, and executes the proper actions
defined in a set of routes by leveraging the other components.

The current implementation of the server uses a thread per connection strategy
and leverages the excellent [polling](https://github.com/smol-rs/polling) lib
to accept connections in a non blocking and portable way.
